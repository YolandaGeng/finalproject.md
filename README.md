Have you ever imagined waking up to your loved one not even remembering who you are? Having to remind your loved one of their name every morning. Imagine all the memories you both shared together disappear. In the end, what is life but the memories we gather and cherish? What if someone stole all those memories away from you? How would you feel? What would you do?

These are the things that people with Alzheimer’s disease have to worry about every single day.

According to Alzheimer’s Association, Alzheimer’s disease is a type of dementia that causes problems with memory, thinking and behavior. Symptoms usually develop slowly and get worse over time, becoming severe enough to interfere with daily tasks. The greatest known risk factor is increasing age, and the majority of people with Alzheimer's are 65 and older. However, Alzheimer's is not just a disease of old age. Approximately 200,000 Americans under the age of 65 have younger-onset Alzheimer’s disease. Alzheimer's is a progressive disease, where dementia symptoms gradually worsen over years. In its early stages, memory loss is mild, but with late-stage Alzheimer's, individuals lose the ability to carry on a conversation and respond to their environment.

“Alzheimer’s disease, unfortunately, right now is still a growing problem,” said Melanie Chavin, the chief program officer at Alzheimer’s Association. “As the disease progresses, memory gets harder for the person and the person needs more and more support, so that also puts a burden on the family caregiver.”

Unfortunately, there is no cure or treatment for the disease right now. 

Here are some numbers about Alzheimer’s disease.

According to the facts provided by Alzheimer’s Association, more than 5 million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s disease. By 2050, this number could raise as high as 16 million. The raising rate is around 33% every year. It is very alarming.  Every 66 seconds someone in the United States develops the disease. Since 2000, deaths from heart disease have decreased by 14%. However, deaths from Alzheimer’s disease have increased by 89%. It kills more than breast cancer and prostate cancer combined. In 2017, Alzheimer’s and other dementias will cost the nation $259 billion. By 2050, it could rise to $1.1 trillion. One in 10 people age 65 and older has Alzheimer's dementia. Almost two-thirds of Americans with Alzheimer's are women.

These numbers are alarming! Especially the raising rate. They exceed many major diseases in the states. The most difficult part is that there is no hope or cure for this problem right now. The only thing people can do is doing various researches to try to find a treatment for it. 

Also, from the data I noticed that the age of people who are suffer from this disease is getting younger and younger. Some people even suffer with this in their 30s. When we think about losing memory, we always think it might not be something that young people need to worry about. However, after knowing those numbers, we need to realize that it is something that could happen to us. Also, people who are suffering with this disease deserve our respect. 

When we talked about this disease, we always think of the patients first. However, the caregivers are also important. Just like what Melanie Chavin said, it puts a burden on family caregivers. 

According to the numbers provided by Alzheimer’s Association, more than 15 million Americans provided unpaid care for people with Alzheimer’s or other dementias. In 2016, these caregivers provided an estimated 18.2 billion hours of care valued at over $230 billion.  This number is huge! Some caregivers need to take care of the patients 24 hours every day, so they have to quit their job and stay at home, which means some of them are facing financial crisis. Just like what is happening to John Mueller and Cheryl Mueller. 

John and Cheryl met each other on March 22, 1980. Couple years after that they got married. “We had a lot of good times,” said Mr. Mueller. About four years ago, in a conversation, she would repeat herself, she would talk about the same thing over and over. About a year later, she is a lot worse. After that, she walked away one day when Mr. Mueller was at work. From then, Mr. Mueller knew that he couldn’t leave her home alone any longer, so he quit his job immediately and decided to stay at home taking care of her.

“I think she knows who I am, but she just doesn’t remember my name anymore,” said Mr. Mueller.

She can’t stand up by herself any more, and she can’t hold any utensils by herself. Therefore, Mr. Mueller needs to hold her all the time and feed her. They don’t have any kid, and all their relatives live far away, so no one can help Mr. Mueller take care of her. It is all up to him. She also loses the ability of talking, Mr. Mueller said he felt lonely sometimes. 

“It obviously robbed her of her life. It just takes away from you everything that you’d hope for,” said Mr. Mueller. “It changes everything. All your dreams are gone.”

Because of the disease, they are having a tight budget in their life. Mr. Mueller never complained about that. He knows that one day she is going to die. 

“When she leaves, I want her to know that she was loved.” Mr. Mueller said.

This couple’s story shows the common life situation of a normal Alzheimer’s family. Especially for the caregivers, on the one hand, they have to accept the fact that their loved one doesn’t remember anything. On the other hand, some of them also need to face the financial crisis. 

All the numbers provided by Alzheimer’s Association also indicate that this is an important issue people need to be aware of. Alzheimer’s Association is the biggest non-profit organization in the states which provides various help for people who are suffering with the disease. It is time for more people to help make a change for Alzheimer’s disease. 


Process:

For some people, Alzheimer’s disease is something they don’t usually pay attention to. The first time I got to know this disease was last September. Alzheimer’s Association held an activity called “Walk to end Alzheimer’s”. People walk together to raise awareness and money for the disease. I went to the activity and met many families who were suffering with the disease. Mr. and Mrs. Mueller are one of the couples I met there. Mrs. Mueller were sitting in a wheelchair and Mr. Mueller was pushing it while he was walking with others. He told me their stories, and at the end of the conversation, he told me that “she has always been my good girl.” I almost cried when I heard that. After that, I started doing researches about this disease and I became friend with John and Cheryl. I also saw their life when I visited them. I was touched and I was sad. Therefore, I decided to do this data story about Alzheimer’s disease. I think more and more people need to know what the disease is and especially what the situation is of the disease. All the numbers indicate how alarming the disease is. I also included some interviews I did before. The main reason is that I believe people who are suffering with the disease deserve our respect.
